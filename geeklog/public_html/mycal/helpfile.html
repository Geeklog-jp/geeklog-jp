<center><b><font size=4>Frequently asked questions</font></b></center>
<H2>Q: Does search follow site security or will it display events or articles in topics not open to user?</H2>
<p>
<b>A:</b> The calendar search feature is integrated with the core Geeklog search function. It includes all the standard permisssion checks and only returns results for the site entries, user has access to.
<p><p>
<H2>Q: What happens if there are no site events for the date selected?</H2>
<p>
<b>A:</b> If the search does not find any site events or updates, a message indicating no results is displayed for three seconds and then automatically returns you to the main portal page.<p><p>
<H2>Q: Why not only enable dates in the calendar with actual site events? </H2>
<p>
<b>A:</b> This would require a search to be performed for every date in advance as the calendar is being created. This would have to be done everytime the calendar block is generated. I already do one such search but just for calendar (schedule) events. Adding this search for the additional system tables to identify all the site updates would be far too much overhead.
<H2>Q: I get an search error when I use this block? </H2>
<p>
<b>A:</b> This component uses the standard GL Search component and will call ALL 
installed plugins. Each plugin can have it's one search function and most do. 
Isolate the problem by using the Geeklog Advanced search form and select one 
plugin via the type selection at a time. Enter a date range using the same date 
for each field to simulate a 1 day search like this component does. You should 
be able to duplicate the problem and isolate the plugin at fault.<p>
