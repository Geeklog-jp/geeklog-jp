Install/Uninstall instruction for the Geeklog tkgmaps plugin.

INSTALL:

Step 1:  Back up your Geeklog Database.  The tkgmaps plugin adds tables to your Geeklog database.  You can do
this with the built in admin backup facility.

Step 2:  Uncompress the tkgmaps plugin archive while in the <geeklog_dir>/plugins directory.  The archive will
create a directory called tkgmaps in the plugins directory.

Step 3:  Create the public_html and admin directories.  Under your html directory (usually public_html) 
create a directory called tkgmaps.  Under your admin/plugins/ directory create a directory called tkgmaps.

Step 4:  Change to your <geeklog_dir>/plugins/tkgmaps/ directory.  Copy the files in the admin directory 
to the admin/plugins/tkgmaps/ directory your created in step 3.  Copy the files and directories in the 
public_html directory to the public_html/tkgmaps/ directory your created in step 3.

Step 5:  Edit the config.php in the tkgmaps directory and confirm the table prefix and anonymous access 
settings and other display settings.  The default is to use the geeklog table prefix and not allow 
anonymous access.

Step 6:  Log in to your Geeklog as a root user and run install.php in your admin/plugins/tkgmaps/ directory.
The install page will tell you if the install was successful or not.  If not examine Geeklog system errorlog
for possible problems.

The tkgmaps plugin should now be installed and functioning.  Clicking on the tkgmaps Icon will
take you to the admin page.  

Step 7: Set up security.  On install only the root users have access to tkgmaps administration and Viewing.  
You can delegate control for either of these functions through the user and group editors.

UNINSTALL:

Step 1:  Run the install.php page in your admin/plugins/tkgmaps directory.  This will remove all the data from
your database.

Step 2:  Delete the three plugin directories created in the install process:  <geeklog-dir>plugins/tkgmaps/ 
<public_html>/tkgmaps/ and <admin>/plugins/tkgmaps/

That's it.
